# chrome-docs-tab-manager
<br>

A simple chrome extension that helps users conveniently organize tabs that point to developer documentation relating to chrome extensions and the web store. 
<br>

* The extension keeps a lookout for tabs that point to certain clusters of developer docs in the chrome developer universe.
  <br>

* All existing tabs that are relevant are queried, sorted, and neatly organized into a dynamic list that can very conveniently be accessed directly through the extension popup.
  <br>
  
* One can very easily click on the individual list items for the appropriate window and tab to be brought to the user's focus.
  <br>

* Users can also create tab groups with unique name and color schemes, bundle stuff together for easier access in the future, etc.
